Description
The File Organizer is a simple desktop application developed using Python's tkinter library. It helps users organize files within a selected directory by categorizing them based on file extensions. Files are automatically moved into predefined folders such as "Images," "Documents," "Audio," "Videos," and more. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface, making it easy for users to select a folder and quickly organize its contents with just a few clicks. This tool is particularly useful for keeping directories neat and quickly finding files of a specific type.
